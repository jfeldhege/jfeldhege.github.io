Transcription enhanced associate domain factor 1 (TEAD1) predicts liver regeneration outcome of ALPPS-treated patients. Hpb : The Official Journal Of The International Hepato Pancreato Biliary Association (2025). https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hpb.2024.12.007\n\n\nKeywords: Humans; Liver Regeneration; Hepatectomy; TEA Domain Transcription Factors; Transcription Factors; Male; DNA-Binding Proteins; Female; Middle Aged; Treatment Outcome; Aged; Portal Vein; Nuclear Proteins; Ligation; YAP-Signaling Proteins; Hepatocytes; Liver; Adult; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two-stage surgical technique of associated liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) enables extensive liver resection and promotes future liver remnant regeneration (FLR), in part by inhibiting the Hippo signalling pathway. Its main effector, Yes-associated protein (YAP), has low intrinsic transcriptional activity and requires the transcription enhanced associated domain factor (TEAD) family members as cofactors for target gene transcription. We evaluated the intracellular localization and expression of TEAD1-4, hypothesized to regulate the activity of YAP and, consequently, liver regeneration. The intracellular localization of TEAD1-4 was characterized in tumor-free liver (TFL) tissue samples from 44 ALPPS patients obtained during the two stages of ALPPS surgery. Expression levels were correlated with clinical and pathological data as well as liver regeneration metrics. TEAD family members are simultaneously expressed in individual hepatocytes and show relations with liver regeneration, clinical outcome and outcome parameters when comparing TFL tissue obtained at different stages of ALPPS surgery. Furthermore, differences in TEAD expression and localization within hepatocytes appeared to be independent of global factors. TEAD1-4 expression correlates with liver regeneration outcomes. Specifically, cytoplasmic and nuclear expression scores of TEAD1 serve as predictive markers for clinical outcomes following ALPPS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDickow, J., Gessler, N., Anwar, O., Feldhege, J., Harloff, T., Hartmann, J., Jularic, M., Wahedi, R., Dinov, B., Wohlmuth, P., Willems, S., Gunawardene, M. Safety of immediate catheter ablation of ventricular arrhythmias in patients admitted via the emergency department. Journal Of Interventional Cardiac Electrophysiology : An International Journal Of Arrhythmias And Pacing (2025). https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10840-025-02020-z\n\n\nKeywords: Catheter ablation; Premature ventricular complex; Risk stratification; Ventricular arrhythmia; Ventricular tachycardia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nIn patients with ventricular arrhythmias (VA) admitted via the emergency department (ED), immediate catheter ablation (CA-VA) might be indicated to stabilize patients. However, the unstable condition of these patients may increase periprocedural risk. This study evaluated the periprocedural safety of immediate CA-VA in patients admitted via the ED. In total, 223 ED patients who underwent immediate CA-VA from 01/2017 to 12/2022 (mean age 66 ± 13 years, 19% female, 55% heart failure, 59% coronary artery disease) were analyzed in terms of in-hospital outcomes (periprocedural death, pericardial tamponade, thromboembolic events, major bleedings). To address differences to elective patients, ED patients were compared with 784 elective CA-VA patients (mean age 59 ± 15 years, 34% female, 20% heart failure, 33% coronary artery disease, all p &lt; 0.001): ED patients experienced higher rates of periprocedural complications (6.3% vs. 2.0%, p = 0.002) driven by thromboembolic events (2.2% vs. 0.4%, p = 0.02). Life-threatening complications were not different between groups (cardiac tamponade: 2.2% vs. 1.4%, p = 0.56; stroke: 0.9% vs. 0.4%, p = 0.67). Seven ED patients (3.1%) died unrelated to the procedure during hospitalization vs. none in the elective CA-VA group. Emergency admission (OR 3.07, 95% CI 1.48-6.38), age (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.22-3.70), and heart failure (OR 1.99, 95% CI 0.96-4.15) were independently associated with periprocedural complications and overall death during hospitalization. Patients with VA admitted via the ED were older, sicker, and more often presented with ventricular tachycardia than elective CA-VA patients. Immediate CA-VA was associated with higher rates of periprocedural complications, driven by thromboembolic events; however, no procedure-related death occurred.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGunawardene, M., Pürerfellner, H., Merino, J., Linz, D., Sultan, A., Scherr, D., Deharo, J., Wohlmuth, P., Feldhege, J., Costa, F., Ribeiro, S., Charitakis, E., Verstrael, A., Anselmino, M., Szeplaki, G., Simovic, S., Jadczyk, T., Adelino, R., Katsoularis, I., Liebregts, M., Tilz, R., Chun, K.

This study aims to assess public perception of CA and identify knowledge gaps. The 36-item PULSE survey was disseminated via social media to the general population and conducted under the auspices of the European Heart Rhythm Association Scientific Initiatives Committee (EHRA SIC) with EHRA patient committee support. Among 3924 participants (2177 healthy, 1747 with previously diagnosed CA; 59% female, 90% European), 81% reported fear of CA. Females were more likely to be ‘very’ or ‘moderately afraid’ than males [odds ratio (OR) 1.159 (1.005, 1.337), P = 0.046]. While most recognized complications of CA-heart failure (82%), stroke (80%), and death (75%)-43% were unaware that CA can be asymptomatic. Those with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training in the past 5 years were 2.6 times and 4.7 times more confident identifying sudden cardiac death and initiating CPR (P &lt; 0.001). Confidence was lower in retired participants [OR 0.574 (0.499, 0.660), P &lt; 0.001] and Southern Europeans [OR 0.703 (0.600, 0.824), P &lt; 0.001]. Without CPR training, only 15% felt confident initiating CPR. Among CA participants, 28% reported severe to disabling daily symptoms. Males were more often asymptomatic (20% vs. 9%, P &lt; 0.001). Treatment rates were comparable between sex categories (81% vs. 79%, P = 0.413). Interdisciplinary shared decision-making processes were reported by 4%. Notably, 1 in 10 CA cases was self-diagnosed using a wearable device, and 30% of CA participants used smartwatches for self-monitoring. Significant knowledge gaps regarding CA exist in the general population. Targeted educational initiatives could be a viable tool to enhance public knowledge, confidence in detecting and managing arrhythmias, particularly for women, who experience greater fear and symptom severity despite similar treatment rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2024\n\n\nWahedi, R., Willems, S., Feldhege, J., Jularic, M., Hartmann, J., Anwar, O., Dickow, J., Harloff, T., Gessler, N., Gunawardene, M. Pulsed-field versus cryoballoon ablation for atrial fibrillation-Impact of energy source on sedation and analgesia requirement.

Comparative data with regard to deep sedation to established single-shot modalities such as cryoballoon (CB) ablation are scarce. The aim of this study was to compare a deep sedation protocol in patients receiving PVI with either PFA or CB. Prospective, consecutive AF patients undergoing PVI with a pentaspline PFA catheter were compared to a retrospective CB-PVI cohort of the same timeframe. Study endpoints were the requirements of analgesics, cardiorespiratory stability, and sedation-associated complications. A total of 100 PVI patients were included (PFA n = 50, CB n = 50, mean age 66 ± 10.6, 61% male patients, 65% paroxysmal AF). Requirement of propofol, midazolam, and sufentanyl was significantly higher in the PFA group compared to CB [propofol 0.14 ± 0.04 mg/kg/min in PFA vs. 0.11 ± 0.04 mg/kg/min in CB (p = .001); midazolam 0.00086 ± 0.0004 mg/kg/min in PFA vs. 0.0006295 ± 0.0003 mg/kg/min in CB (p = .002) and sufentanyl 0.0013 ± 0.0007 µg/kg/min in PFA vs. 0.0008 ± 0.0004 µg/kg/min in CB (p &lt; .0001)]. Sedation-associated complications did not differ between both groups (PFA n = 1/50 mild aspiration pneumonia, CB n = 0/50, p &gt; .99). Nonsedation-associated complications (PFA: n = 2/50, 4%, CB: n = 1/50, 2%, p &gt; .99) and procedure times (PFA 75 ± 31, CB 84 ± 32 min, p = .18) did not differ between groups. PFA is associated with higher sedation and especially analgesia requirements. However, the\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2023\n\n\nFeldhege, J., Wolf, M., Moessner, M., Bauer, S. Psycholinguistic changes in the communication of adolescent users in a suicidal ideation online community during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Many adolescents experiencing suicidal ideation turn to online communities for social support. In this retrospective observational study, we investigated the communication-language style, contents and user activity-in 7975 unique posts and 51,119 comments by N = 2862 active adolescent users in a large suicidal ideation support community (SISC) on the social media website reddit.com in the onset period of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found significant relative changes in language style markers for hopelessness such as negative emotion words (+ 10.00%) and positive emotion words (- 3.45%) as well as for social disengagement such as social references (- 8.63%) and 2nd person pronouns (- 33.97%) since the outbreak of the pandemic. Using topic modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), we identified significant changes in content for the topics Hopelessness (+ 23.98%), Suicide Methods (+ 17.11%), Social Support (- 14.91%), and Reaching Out to users (- 28.97%). Changes in user activity point to an increased expression of mental health issues and decreased engagement with other users. The results indicate a potential shift in communication patterns with more adolescent users expressing their suicidal ideation rather than relating with or supporting other users during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKostev, K., Hagemann-Goebel, M., Gessler, N., Wohlmuth, P., Feldhege, J., Arnold, D., Jacob, L., Gunawardene, M., Hölting, T., Koyanagi, A., Schreiber, R., Smith, L., Sheikhzadeh, S., Wollmer, M. Is there an association between depression, anxiety disorders and COVID-19 severity and mortality? A multicenter retrospective cohort study conducted in 50 hospitals in Germany.

This retrospective study was based on anonymized electronic medical data from 50 public healthcare service hospitals across Germany. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to study associations between depression, anxiety and mechanical ventilation and mortality due to COVID adjusted for age, sex, time of COVID-19 diagnosis, and pre-defined co-diagnoses. Of 28,311 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 1970 (6.9%) had a diagnosis of depression and 369 (1.3%) had a diagnosis of anxiety disorder prior to contracting COVID-19. While multivariable logistic regression models did not indicate any association between depression diagnosis and the risk of mechanical ventilation, depression was associated with a decreased risk of mortality (OR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.53-0.94). There was no association between anxiety disorders and risk of mortality, but there was a strong positive association between anxiety disorders and the risk of mechanical ventilation (OR: 2.04; 95% CI: 1.35-3.10). In the present study, depression and anxiety disorder diagnoses were not associated with increased COVID-19 mortality. Anxiety disorder was strongly associated with an increased risk of mechanical ventilation. Further studies are needed to clarify how depression and anxiety disorders may influence COVID-19 severity and mortality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKonermann, F., Gessler, N., Wohlmuth, P., Behr, J., Feldhege, J., Gloeckner, C., Gunawardene, M., Herrlinger, K., Hoelting, T., Pape, U., Reinmuth, N., Stang, A., Sheikhzadeh, S., Arnold, D., Wesseler, C.

However, limited data are available regarding in-hospital mortality during the Omicron phase of the pandemic. Therefore, the aim of the study was the comparison of mortality in patients with history of cancer and patients with active cancer disease during the different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the current Omicron variant of concern. We conducted a multicenter, observational, epidemiological cohort study at 45 hospitals in Germany. Until July 20, 2022, all adult hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were included. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality regarding cancer status (history of cancer and active cancer disease) and SARS-CoV-2 virus type. From March 11, 2020, to July 20, 2022, a total of 27,490 adult SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were included in the study. 2,578 patients (9.4%) had diagnosis of cancer, of whom 1,065 (41.3%) had history of cancer, whereas 1,513 (58.7%) had active cancer disease. Overall 3,749 out of the total of 27,490 patients (13.6%) died during the hospital stay. Patients with active cancer disease had a significantly higher mortality compared to patients without cancer diagnosis, in both phases of the pandemic (wild-type to Delta: OR 1.940 [1.646-2.285]); Omicron: 2.864 [2.354-3.486]). After adjustment to co-variables, SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with active cancer disease had the highest risk for in-hospital mortality compared to the other groups, in both phases of the pandemic. The CORONA Germany study indicates that hospitalized patients with active cancer disease are at high risk of death during a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mortality of patients with history of cancer improved to nearly the level of non-cancer patients during Omicron phase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDickow, J., Gunawardene, M., Willems, S., Feldhege, J., Wohlmuth, P., Bachmann, M., Bergmann, M., Gesierich, W., Nowak, L., Pape, U., Schreiber, R., Wirtz, S., Twerenbold, R., Sheikhzadeh, S., Gessler, N.

Plos One (2023). https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0292017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the emergence of new subvariants, the disease severity of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 has attenuated. This study aimed to compare the disease severity in patients hospitalized with omicron variant infection to those with influenza infection. We compared data from the multicenter observational, prospective, epidemiological “CORONA Germany” (Clinical Outcome and Risk in hospitalized COVID-19 patients) study on patients infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 to retrospective data on influenza infection cases from November 2016 to August 2022. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 cases were classified as wild-type/delta variant before January 2022, or omicron variant from January 2022 onward. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, adjusted for age, gender, and comorbidities. The study included 35,806 patients from 53 hospitals in Germany, including 4,916 patients (13.7%) with influenza infection, 16,654 patients (46.5%) with wild-type/delta variant infection, and 14,236 patients (39.8%) with omicron variant infection. In-hospital mortality was highest in patients with wild-type/delta variant infection (16.8%), followed by patients with omicron variant infection (8.4%) and patients with influenza infection (4.7%). In the adjusted analysis, higher age was the strongest predictor for in-hospital mortality (age 80 years vs. age 50 years: OR 4.25, 95% CI 3.10-5.83). Both, patients with wild-type/delta variant infection (OR 3.54, 95% CI 3.02-4.15) and patients with omicron variant infection (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.32-1.84) had a higher risk for in-hospital mortality than patients with influenza infection. After adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities, patients with wild-type/delta variant infection had the highest risk for in-hospital mortality compared to patients with influenza infection. Even for patients with omicron variant infection, the adjusted risk for in-hospital mortality was higher than for patients\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2022\n\n\nFeldhege, J., Gulec, H., Moessner, M., Stieler, C., van Stipelen, J., Bauer, S.

A total of 507 adolescents (N = 139 Germans; N = 126 Immigrants; N = 242 Turks) read a vignette describing a 16-year-old female with bulimic symptoms. Participants completed questionnaires on mental health literacy, stigmatization, desirability of eating disorder-related behaviors and acquaintance with bulimic symptoms. Adolescents living in Germany were more likely to recognize the vignette as an eating disorder than Turks. Immigrants were more similar to Germans in mental health literacy of eating disorders than Turks. However, in terms of stigmatizing attitudes, immigrants blamed more than Germans, Turks being intermediate on this variable. In Turks, higher desirability of eating disorder-related behaviors was associated with an increased acquaintance with bulimic symptoms and decreased evaluations of impairment. Higher mental health literacy was associated with less blame in Germans. Migration background was associated with increased mental health literacy of eating disorders but did not result in reduced stigma. Differences in attitudes toward eating disorders indicate the need for differential interventions across the groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeldhege, J., Bilic, S., Ali, K., Fassnacht, D., Moessner, M., Farrer, L., Griffiths, K., Bauer, S.

Associations between ED-MHL, stigma, ED symptomatology, and gender were investigated in a sample of N = 194 German high school students. Knowledge and myths about EDs were assessed with 18 factual statements about EDs and agreement/disagreement with common myths about ED. Students also completed the Universal Stigma Scale (USS), the Weight Concerns Scale (WCS), and demographic items. Students judged M = 8.39 (SD = 3.40) statements correctly, while the average agreement with all ED myths was low (M = 0.19, SD = 0.14). Greater ED-MHL was associated with lower stigmatization of EDs. Male participants were less knowledgeable and more likely to agree with the ED myths. Participants displayed moderate ED-MHL; however, certain aspects such as ED risk factors or symptoms of specific disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa were less well known. These results can inform the design of future MHL interventions for adolescents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\nFeldhege, J., Moessner, M., Bauer, S. Who says what?

This study investigates the prevailing topics in an online depression community and how they are related to participation styles. A topic model with 26 topics of N = 16,291 posts and N = 71,543 comments of N = 20,037 users in a depression forum on Reddit was created using Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). The topics’ proportions in the corpus were correlated with five participation measures, i.e. sum of scores, number of comments, posts to comments ratio, posting frequency, and word count. The most common topics were Feelings, Motivation, The Community on Reddit, and Time. There were many significant, small to moderate correlations between topic proportions and participation style measures. The topics Feelings, Offering Support, and Small Talk generated a bigger response in the form of scores and comments. Talking about the past and relationships was more common in longer posts, whereas small talk, offering emotional support, and employing cognitive strategies was more readily found in short comments. Lower posting frequency was related to talking about feelings and romantic relationships. No information on users’ demographics or mental health status was available. Topic modeling cannot capture elements of style and tone of text. A wide spectrum of topics was uncovered in the topic modeling. Patterns in the correlations point to users with different participation styles preferring different topics. Results of this study can aid the development of online interventions for depression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAli, K., Fassnacht, D., Farrer, L., Rieger, E., Feldhege, J., Moessner, M., Griffiths, K., Bauer, S. What prevents young adults from seeking help? Barriers toward help-seeking for eating disorder symptomatology.

Differences in perceived barriers as a function of type of eating disorder symptomatology were also examined. Data were collected using an online survey among individuals (aged 18-25 years) in Australia. Overall, 291 young adults with varying levels of eating disorder symptoms completed measures of disordered eating, weight or shape concerns, help-seeking barriers, attitudes, intentions, and behaviors. According to their self-reported symptoms, participants were classified into four subgroups (i.e., anorexia nervosa [AN] symptoms, bulimia nervosa [BN] symptoms, binge-eating disorder [BED] symptoms, and other eating disorder symptoms). Despite the belief that help-seeking is useful, only a minority of participants with elevated symptoms, namely those with AN, BN, and BED symptoms, believed they needed help. Across the sample, the most frequently cited barriers to seeking help for eating disorder symptoms were: concern for others, self-sufficiency, fear of losing control, denial and failure to perceive the severity of the illness, and stigma and shame. The findings highlight the need to educate young adults about the severity of eating disorders and the importance of seeking help, and to increase the awareness of help-seeking barriers among those designing public health interventions as well as clinicians. Our findings suggest that help-seeking barriers may differ depending on the type of eating disorder symptomology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeldhege, J., Moessner, M., Wolf, M., Bauer, S.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the health and safety measures taken to contain its spread also disrupted routines and reduced access to familiar coping mechanisms, social support networks, and health care services. Social media and the ED communities on social media platforms have been an important source of support for individuals with EDs in the past. So far, it is unknown how discussions in online ED communities changed as offline support networks were disrupted and people spent more time at home in the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study is to identify changes in language content and style in an online ED community during the initial onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We extracted posts and their comments from the ED community on the social media website Reddit and concatenated them to comment threads. To analyze these threads, we applied top-down and bottom-up language analysis methods based on topic modeling with latent Dirichlet allocation and 13 indicators from the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count program, respectively. Threads were split into prepandemic (before March 11, 2020) and midpandemic (after March 11, 2020) groups. Standardized mean differences were calculated to estimate change between pre- and midpandemic threads. A total of 17,715 threads (n=8772, 49.5% prepandemic threads; n=8943, 50.5% midpandemic threads) were extracted from the ED community and analyzed. The final topic model contained 21 topics. CIs excluding zero were found for standardized mean differences of 15 topics and 9 Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count categories covering themes such as ED symptoms, mental health, treatment for EDs, cognitive processing, social life, and emotions.

To date, it is unknown to which extent participation in pro-ED communities affects users’ body weight and desired weight loss. This study aims to investigate the changes in the current and desired body weight of users of a pro-ED community (r/proed) on the social media website Reddit over time. Data on 1170 users and the unsolicited weight information they shared with the pro-ED community were collected over a period of 15 months. Linear growth models were used to model changes in the users’ current and desired BMI over time. Both current and desired BMI decreased over time, with a predicted rate of 0.087 and 0.015 BMI points per week, respectively. Weight loss was moderated by the users’ activity level in the community, with more active users losing more weight. Users with a higher baseline BMI experienced greater weight loss, but even users with a very low baseline weight (BMI &lt;17 kg/m2) lost weight during their participation. In addition, users decreased their desired weight over time, with many pursuing extremely low, unrealistic weight goals. Changes in the desired weight were moderated by the baseline current BMI and baseline desired BMI. Users with higher desired weight and lower body weight at baseline decreased their desired weight more over time. This is the first study to demonstrate the detrimental effects of pro-ED communities in a longitudinal study based on a large data set of user-generated online data. The results extend the literature detailing the harmful effects of online pro-ED communities by showing users’ weight loss, decreases in desired weight, and that higher activity levels lead to greater weight loss. Users could be driven to pursue very low, unrealistic weight loss goals by images of very thin bodies presented in these communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2019\n\n\nMoessner, M., Feldhege, J., Wolf, M., Bauer, S. Analyzing big data in social media: Text and network analyses of an eating disorder forum. The International Journal Of Eating Disorders (2019). https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eat.22878\n\n\nKeywords: big data; eating disorders; social media; social network analysis; text analysis; Algorithms; Big Data; Central Nervous System Stimulants; Data Mining; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Humans; Internet; Language; Linear Models; Natural Language Processing; Programming Languages; Risk Factors; Social Media; Social Networking; Social Support; Software\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial media plays an important role in everyday life of young people. Numerous studies claim negative effects of social media and media in general on eating disorder risk factors. Despite the availability of big data, only few studies have exploited the possibilities so far in the field of eating disorders. Methods for data extraction, computerized content analysis, and network analysis will be introduced. Strategies and methods will be exemplified for an ad-hoc dataset of 4,247 posts and 34,118 comments by 3,029 users of the proed forum on Reddit. Text analysis with latent Dirichlet allocation identified nine topics related to social support and eating disorder specific content. Social network analysis describes the overall communication patterns, and could identify community structures and most influential users. A linear network autocorrelation model was applied to estimate associations in language among network neighbors. The supplement contains R code for data extraction and analyses. This paper provides an introduction to investigating social media data, and will hopefully stimulate big data social media research in eating disorders. When applied in real-time, the methods presented in this manuscript could contribute to improving the safety of ED-related online communication."
